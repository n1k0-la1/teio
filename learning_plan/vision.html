                    <h3><u>Short-term Vision:</u></h3>
                    <p>[under the recomendation of my classmates this paragraph has been removed. If u wanna see it ctrl+u it's in the code]</p>
                    <!--<p>My vision for this year is I wanna actually be good at art.. I know I say that all the time but I'M BAD ALL THE TIME!!! Maybe not this year, but the next, I'd like to be 'good enough' (in my eyes, anyways,) to open commissions because
                        I'm BROKE! I need to fund my doll addiction somehow! I blew all my money @ sakuracon!!! I feel like my draftsmanship in art is especially poor.. I'm horrible at sketching which SUCKS! I don't <i>want</i> to do studies but I know
                        I have to if I want to get better in this lifetime. I really want to work on that, and also work on drawing <i>faster</i>. I feel like I take forever, and by the time I finish a piece it sucks.
                        <-which is why I 'm doing my project! wow! connections!  </p>-->
                    <p>Academically, I want to focus more this year on school because it's my <i>first year of highschool!</i> I can't be acting like this anymore! I feel like I'm behind on math even though I'm probably not.. But you know how it is. This
                        year I want to focus in tutoring so <i>next year</i> I can be in a place where I can start working on SAT prep math and what not. I really want to get into running start (because I'm broke) and I know to do that you have to pass
                        the college's entrance exam, which I'm pretty anxious about. I did a practice test in May and I got a score of 1260 which is good i think but not quite competitive? By senior year my (unrealistic) goal is 1550, but i'll be happy
                        with 1400.</p>
                    <p>Another thing I want to work on in academics is my chinese.. Right now I'm taking classes every Sat but my goal is to eventually be fluent enought to be able to do the World Lang. by Proficiency test thing where you can get 4- HS credits.
                        Right I can pretty much only write/read basic sentences for a couple topics… (greetings, food, counting, like/dislike, seasons, family members, classmates, etc.) /__＼ Beyond the test, what I really want is to be able to read SVSSS/LOTM/GHG
                        in chinese. Maybe give that one 10 years.</p>
                    <p>I want to get an internship at an art museum of course— the dream would be the SAM (Seattle Art Museum)—but that's not happening, lol. I said look into art galleries but after interviewing people who've worked at them before—Wow they
                        sound like they sorta suck! Not just in a 'I have to deal with stuck up rich people' kinda way, but also in a 'wow. the horrors of capitalisim' kinda way. Also from doing interviews, shadow days, etc. I've learned that the thing
                        I enjoy most about the job is taking care of the same collection over a long period of time, getting to know it, etc.; and that wouldn't be possible in a commercial gallery because things are always being sold.</p>
                    <p><s>All in all, I want to get all exemplaries on my exhibition from everyone all the time!!! Do not speak to me on how realistic that is.</s></p>
                    <h3><u>Long-term Vision:</u></h3>
                    <p>For my long term vision~ Uhm.. I wanna graduate high school, of course.. And I hope to get into UW or some other school with a good library science/adjacent program. I think I want to do a MLIS (Masters of library and information science)
                        with a BA in art history or something similar. This would allow me to have the degreee that's basically a necessity, while still being able to do an arts thing. I waaas contemplating getting a BA in fine art, but… I dont think
                        the routes you usually like being an artist @ a game design studio or something. take Also, I was contemplating doing a Master of Arts in Museology, but I think that applies more to curator/exhibit desgn positions, which isn't
                        really what I'm going for.</p>
                    <p>I just want to have a job as an archivist/collections assistant/curator at an art museum. My… Dream job? right now is probably a collections assistant/archivist that works with art pieces, dolls, books, etc. someone who doesn't have
                        to set up things; and only has to email people to follow up on artifacts. And to make $50/hr. Is that too much to ask?</p>
                    <p>I wanna live in an apartment (maybe) or house (probably not) somewhere in a big city with public transportation. Probably here in Seattle, to be honest. I'll probably die here. You have to somewhere, I suppose. I wanna have two cats,
                        lots and lots of dolls, and a full pension/401k/RothIRA so I can retire early. (at 60) If i were to move out of the us though... (looks around nervously) probably somewhere in Hong Kong, maybe? Depends on how far my chinese is/if
                        i make money, cus housing prices over there... Crazy.
