                            <h3><u>What were your initial success criteria? (Copy them from your proposal.)</u></h3>
                            <p>Soooo, I feel like I take forever forever to draw, and it sucks because that means I make less drawings (duh) which means I get good slower which is BAD! I also want to develop my guys more, because… oh em gee… I look at other
                                people's and I'm like… WAAAOWIE!!! so cool! so fleshed! this person has done lots of ruminating and reflection about their guys! I want to be like that! So basically this project is me attempting to work on both of those
                                problems; forcing me to fail quickly/draw quicker and more to fill up the skechbook in time, and also have a vector to constantly think out my ideas. I have a lot of stuff bouncing around in my brain and this would be a
                                nice place to put them
                            </p>
                            <p>If all goes well (lol), I at the end of this project I hope to have a completely filled, standard sized sketchbook with NO PAGES RIPPED OUT OR GLUED TOGETHER! I think a big issue I have is I just can't start, and I give up
                                very quickly when I looks bad. I need to get over myself (as always) and get more comfortable with my mistakes if I want to get anywhere. also maybe it would make me get better fast handwriting. Which would be good.</p>

                            <p>I think this would fall under RESEARCH AND INQUIRY because I'm reasearching what goes into a concept design, PRODUCTIVE MINDSET because I'm activley pushing myself to move on even when I'm not happy with things which helps
                                develop a more 'Positive self-concept and growth mindset' and 'relistic-self-apprasal' because it's FINE if it doesn't look good like actuallt its FINE i dont have to lie to myself and also beingn a REFLECTIVE LEARNER because
                                I'm 'Identify[ing] strengths and growth areas, exploring personal history, and how current perspectives originated' and by mulling on the same ideas I'm 'establishing and maintaining clarity of purpose; [and] persevering.'</p>

                            <p>I genuinely think my art got better over the course of these couple months! Yippee! Like if you flip through, wow... Noses... Proportions... Lore...</p>

                            <h3><u>In what ways was your project unsuccessful?</u></h3>
                            <p>I did not finish the sketchbook... Because I can't count. I think next time, instead of just extending my timelines to account for naivety, I also need to account for my own ability to start things.</p>

                            <h3><u>If you were to do this project again, what would you do differently?
                            </u></h3>
                            <p>
                                stop dragging my feet over everything all the time, holy shit, and not be so picky with my sketchbook choices in the beginning when i ended up just getting the one that was discounted at Joann's.

                            </u></h3>
                            <p>I think the biggest learning in this, (as always... :rolling eyes emoji:) was PQ. Forcing myself to just get something on the paper, and not going back in infitely adjust and fix up my previous pages, has really helped with
                                my complex me thinks.</p>
