                            <p>Blah blah something something <a href="https://wiki.melonland.net/web_revival" target="_blank"> web revival manifesto.</a> I believe the web should belong to it's users. (The web belongs to cats!)</p>
                            <p>My desired outcome is making a "Full"-ish website, meaning having all the links in my sidebar working. (About me; Credits; Image blog; Art; Toybox. BJD Shrine pages are not a part of this project because that's kinda a really
                                big endevor I think would be better as a sperate project, and also my big doll isn't even here yet as of writing this lol) Unlike these learning plan pages, I want all of them to be different pages/not just using the same
                                template, like how my <a href="/blog.html">Diary</a> is distinct from my homepage. Except for the 'About Me' & 'Credits' pages, probably. I also want to make a learning plan/portfolio, from scratch, that fits my needs because
                                google docs & drive is LAME!</p>
                            <p>This project is interesting/relevent to me because I 1) want a place where I can showcase my art/thoughts with out algorithm stuff bothering me, and I feel like the basic LP format isn't for me, (BORING REASON!) and 2) I think
                                cute, fun websites like this are important 4 enrichment 'nd a healthy web diet (FUN REASON!) . Oh and 3) I want to further my knowlage of html/css/js I guess.</p>

                            <p>Weeelllll… I definitely learned a lot about HTML n CSS over the course of this project, that's for sure. Looking back at the code I wrote when I first started the website.the portfolio honestly kinda makes me cringe… >
                                <… It 's bad. Like. WHHHYYYYYY is the table like that. Why is everything a class ???? I think I want to redo everything… eventually. So I guess those're next steps. Anyways. I think the credits page is preeetty cute, but the about me page could be.. Better.
                                    Tried to do a picnic theme but it did 't come acrros me thinks so I'm going to redo proooobs. If I feel like it.</p>
                                    <p><b><mark>UPDATE!!</mark></b> this is niko from the future now that the update's been out for a while, look at these messages that people left on my <a href="https://nik0la1.atabook.org/">Guestbook</a>! I'd say it's
                                        pretty sucsessful, peer review win!<img src="/learning_plan/projects/images/Screenshot 2025-05-28 at 09-38-06 nik0la1's guestbook - Atabook.png" style="display: block; width: 90%; margin: auto;"></p>

                            <p>A lot! I dragged everything out way too long, as always… It seems I always have issues with juggling multiple things; and I have problems with focusing on one thing at once and forgetting everything else. <a href="/assets/deco/oops.jpg">oops</a>                                ALso, like I said… About me page doesn't look that good… sigh… And tbh… I'm not sure if this shouldv'e been a project anyways… lol?? Like this is very something that's always happening? Always something I can build on,
                                something I won't 'finish' because I keep adding more and more. Oops.</p>

                            </u></h3>
                            <p>Maybe don't do it, as I said before. Or try to think through the 'finishing' conditions more.
                            </p>

                            </u></h3>
                            <p>Uaagh… I was high up on a Dunning-Kruger peak, like… waaaaay too confident about my ability to do anything ever. Okay. Maybe that's hyperbole. I wasn't that bad. But really, looking back at my code from the beginning of this
                                project makes me cringe. My skills in HTML, and especially css, have grown a lot over the course of this project, but I think I could still do some more work on the CSS, and learn more about Javascript. Obviously, this
                                is ER because coding blah blah blah; but I think it's also 'Design and Scientific Inquiry' the way I researched (looked at other people's sites) -> designed/sketched my idea -> write out the code -> debug & i think it's
                                also 'Expression and Analysis'+'Multimedia Literacy' the way I "Express and analyze complex thoughts and ideas through various artistic forms" and "Develop[ing] fluency in multiple commuications media". Ya.</p>
