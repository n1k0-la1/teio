                        <p> starting point for boxes and cylinders and such. 4 points -> connect edges -> make x in the middle to find center -> extend from middle to section into quarters -> divide 2 sides diagonally -> find intersection with center point
                            -> drop line -> do same on other side -> boom sectioned into thirds. to do cylinder arch in each quarter</p>

                        <p>used this as a primer on life drawing/figure drawing instead of fumbling around blindly like normal. it's pretty comphrehensive & i didn't read it cover to cover, instead I read the intro and basic bits, and will page pack to anything
                            I have difficulty with. It has a schedule for figure drawing which i hope to adapt into something I can do over the summer; (it's a little daunting as it is now) and the main points I took from it were 'gesture' and 'contour'
                            drawing, and the basics of each</p>

                        <p>describes my art making complex to a t, almost. You could even say I was read like a book. Don't though. This was really comforting to hear others also describe my issues, and it helped me stop dragging my feet on filling up the
                            sketchbook. Stopping, starting, and stopping again on a piece is fine. Restarting is a natural part of the cycle of creation. Making 'mundane' art is hard. It's fine. Quanity over quality, and such.</p>
