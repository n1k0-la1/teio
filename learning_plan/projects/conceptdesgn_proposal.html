                    <h3><u>I. Introduction ԅ(¯﹃¯ԅ)</u></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> What is the purpose of your project? What is the question or Idea you are exploring?</li>
                        <li> What are your desired outcomes? What are you hoping to learn/produce?</li>
                        <li> Why is this project interesting or relevant to you?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Soooo, I feel like I take forever forever to draw, and it sucks because that means I make less drawings (duh) which means I get good slower which is BAD! I also want to develop my guys more, because… oh em gee… I look at other people's
                        and I'm like… WAAAOWIE!!! so cool! so fleshed! this person has done lots of ruminating and reflection about their guys! I want to be like that! So basically this project is me attempting to work on both of those problems; forcing
                        me to fail quickly/draw quicker and more to fill up the skechbook in time, and also have a vector to constantly think out my ideas. I have a lot of stuff bouncing around in my brain and this would be a nice place to put them
                    </p>
                    <p>If all goes well (lol), I at the end of this project I hope to have a completely filled, standard sized sketchbook with NO PAGES RIPPED OUT OR GLUED TOGETHER! I think a big issue I have is I just can't start, and I give up very quickly
                        when I looks bad. I need to get over myself (as always) and get more comfortable with my mistakes if I want to get anywhere. also maybe it would make me get better fast handwriting. Which would be good.</p>

                    <p>I think this would fall under RESEARCH AND INQUIRY because I'm reasearching what goes into a concept design, PRODUCTIVE MINDSET because I'm activley pushing myself to move on even when I'm not happy with things which helps develop
                        a more 'Positive self-concept and growth mindset' and 'relistic-self-apprasal' because it's FINE if it doesn't look good like actuallt its FINE i dont have to lie to myself and also beingn a REFLECTIVE LEARNER because I'm 'Identify[ing]
                        strengths and growth areas, exploring personal history, and how current perspectives originated' and by mulling on the same ideas I'm 'establishing and maintaining clarity of purpose; [and] persevering.'</p>
                    <h3><u>II. Organization (*^-^*)</u></h3>
                    <ul>

                                        <li>look at serious real art books and collections of concept art & and maybe take notes. -Probably not that's weird. I just said that to sound academic. Sorry</li>
                                        <li>while doing above, look at sketchbooks and decide which to use. Needs approcable paper that also will sit nicely w/ pastels & paint markers</li>

                    <p>I will keep track of my progress by having a project log, for real this time. With a progress bar of how many pages I have left? -Or maybe not. That might encourage bad behavior.</p>
                    <h3><u>III. Research ::>-<::</u></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> What information do you need in order to complete this project?</li>
                        <li> What are some sources where you can get this information? (Remember, expert interviews count as sources!)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I need to know what concept art books/sketchbooks usually consist of, even if I won't abide by it; and I need to find a type of sketchbook I'll actually use in the first place. I can find this information by reading art books, stalking
                        artist's I admire's pages to look at their art and sketchbook tours (those still exist I think); and uhm… Go touch a bunch of paper. Ask Andy what that nice paper at art & chill is called. Stalk through r*ddit threads.</p>
                    <h3><u>IV. Plan for Reflection (°ロ°)</u></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> How will you record your progress and colect evidence of your learning?</li>
                        <li> How will you get feedback on your project along the way?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Along the way, I will constantly subject anyone who will listen with tales of my visions to make sure I sound coherent; and at the end I will draw a full piece to see if finishing it has improved my drawing time. Right now, it takes
                        like. 10-20 hours for a full piece, so anything under 10 will be apreciated.</p>
                    <h3><u>V. Plan for Assesment （；´д｀）ゞ</u></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> How will you determine if your final project is "good"?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As said above, I really need to work on getting over myself, so as long as it 1) is filled up 2) doesn't have any ripped out pages and 3) is mostly consisted of my characters it will be a success. Of course, I say that, but I will
                        still angst over it and be a little annoying brat about it being bad, lol. Just ignore that me</p>
