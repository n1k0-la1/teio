                    <ul>
                        <li> What is the purpose of your project? What is the question or Idea you are exploring?</li>
                        <li> What are your desired outcomes? What are you hoping to learn/produce?</li>
                        <li> Why is this project interesting or relevant to you?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Blah blah something something <a href="https://wiki.melonland.net/web_revival" target="_blank"> web revival manifesto.</a> I believe the web should belong to it's users. (The web belongs to cats!)</p>
                    <p>My desired outcome is making a "Full"-ish website, meaning having all the links in my sidebar working. (About me; Credits; Image blog; Art; Toybox. BJD Shrine pages are not a part of this project because that's kinda a really big endevor
                        I think would be better as a sperate project, and also my big doll isn't even here yet as of writing this lol) Unlike these learning plan pages, I want all of them to be different pages/not just using the same template, like how
                        my <a href="/blog.html">Diary</a> is distinct from my homepage. Except for the 'About Me' & 'Credits' pages, probably. I also want to make a learning plan/portfolio, from scratch, that fits my needs because google docs & drive
                        is LAME!</p>
                    <p>This project is interesting/relevent to me because I 1) want a place where I can showcase my art/thoughts with out algorithm stuff bothering me, and I feel like the basic LP format isn't for me, (BORING REASON!) and 2) I think cute,
                        fun websites like this are important 4 enrichment 'nd a healthy web diet (FUN REASON!) . Oh and 3) I want to further my knowlage of html/css/js I guess.</p>
                    <h3><u>II. Organization (*^-^*)</u></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> What are the different phases of the project, and when do you want to finish them?</li>
                        <li> What are your first steps/tasks?</li>
                        <li> How will you keep track of your progress?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I will keep track of my progress through the 'Updates!' box on my homepage.</p>

                    <p>Information I need to complete this project is a html/css wiki I can look things up on; A tutorial for the gallery images thing/A database of html tutorials in general lol… I don't know what I'm doing… and probably more I'm not thinking
                        of right now. To get this information, I'll use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools,</a> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN,</a> and the <a href="https://wiki.melonland.net/start"

                    <ul>
                        <li> How will you record your progress and colect evidence of your learning?</li>
                        <li> How will you get feedback on your project along the way?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I'll get feedback on my project by going online and going: "Haii please look at my website is it good" and other people (strangers) will go: "I think it's [■■] and I like [■■] but I think you could improve on [■■] by doing [■■]" :)</p>
                    <h3><u>V. Plan for Assesment （；´д｀）ゞ</u></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> How will you determine if your final project is "good"?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I'll go ask people "please rate my website". No I dunno. Sorry.</p>
