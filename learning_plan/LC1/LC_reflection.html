                        are what you should discuss at your exhibition. </p>

                    <h3><u>Where do you feel your learning plan falls on this rubric?</u></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> What competencies have you engaged in through your learning plan goals?</li>
                        <li>How much did you use your learning plan to guide your learning?</li>
                        <li> How effective were you in accomplishing the goals on your learning plan?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Okay I usually never say exemplary usually because it’s embarrassing when nobody else agrees and I look like an ass but I do feel like my learning plan (unlike everything else… We’ll get to that…) is in the <mark><b>low exemplaries</b></mark>                        this LC! This is because I feel like it's very authentic, and even though it may not be as 'complete' or 'rigorous' as my previous one was, I think that's mostly just because it's still the beginning of the year and I haven't used
                        it/been doing independent/LTI/project work for long; but I feel like the way I've formatted has a lot of built-in room for me to make it more rigorous. </p>
                    <p>I also feel like I use my LP in a bit of a different way, where I also add goals I haven't started on, and don't expect to start on, into my learning plan as a.. Reminder? Bucket list? So I think it's a little unfair to include those
                        against me for completion'. Ignoring those though, I do think that It's already more 'complete' than my previous percentage-wise because I used to have lots of goals I wasn't very enthusiastic about/that weren't authentic to me,
                        just because I wanted to have more goals in each competency so it would 'look more impressive'. With this LP I put 'em all in one spot so that wouldn't be an issue anymore; and I rearranged them into categories that fit <i>me</i>                        more as a person. </p>
                    <h3><u>Where do you feel your new learning falls on this rubric?</u></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> What new knowledge and skills did you learn this year?</li>
                        <li> How does your new learning connect to the competencies?</li>
                        <li> How well have you documented the evidence of your learning?</li>
                        <li>How does your new learning connect to your long term vision?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Mhm... I feel like my new learning is in the <mark><b>low significants</b></mark> this LC? I say this because even though looking back, I can see that I know how to do a lot of new things <i>now</i> that I didn't know how to do <i>then</i>                        in the beginning, (e.g. basically all my coding & Chinese knowledge,) I feel like I have a lot of trouble articulating what I've learned, and sometimes, even remembering that it's 'something new'. Maybe it's the overcompartmentalization,
                        but I have a hard time thinking of anything that I didn't do in the last couple of weeks as 'new'; which leads to me not really being able to explain what I've learned. </p>
                    <p>Even with that though, I do think I've learned a lot this LC which shouldn't be discounted because 'I forgor', which is why I think it should be in significant rather than some. Also low scores make me depressed. Smile.</p>
                    <h3><u>Where do you feel your project work falls on this rubric?</u></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> What new learning did you do in your projects? How does it connect to the competencies?</li>
                        <li>How has your ability to plan and execute projects grown?</li>
                        <li> What personal meaning did your projects have for you?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Sighhh... <mark><b>Some</b></mark> progress... :/ I haven't done a lot in my project—only the first phase—which <i>I'll say</i> is because we started quite late into the LC as we had the whole class 'Who am I/Who are we project' to
                        do first; and we had the whole technology thing; and I was really caught up in getting used to doing LTI work; but who am I kidding. You and I both know those are just excuses.
                        <br> I know it wasn't needed nor expected for me to finish my project, but I feel like I should've at least gotten halfway. That has, obviously, not happened. Next LC, I'd like to say that as I become used to LTI and all the scheduling
                        quirks, I'll be able to return to my project, but.. You know. Here's hoping, I guess.</p>
                    <h3><u>Where do you feel your LTI work falls on this rubric?</u></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> What have you learned through your LTI work so far? How does it connect to the competencies?</li>
                        <li> How have you improved your ability to work professionally with adults?</li>
                        <li> How are your LTI experiences helping you achieve your long term vision?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I think my LTI this LC falls solidly in the <mark><b>significant</b></mark> category? Even if it's a little unremarkable; I feel like I did good and I've provided solid evidence to back up each LTI experience. Even though there isn't
                        a lot, every one is strongly connected to my vision of what I want to do in the future.</p>
                    <h3><u>What have been your greatest successes for this learning cycle?</u></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> What did you do to achieve these successes?</li>
                        <li> What are you going to do next year to keep improving?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I'm going to be honest this LC was a bit of.. Well. You know. I feel like there weren't many successes. I think me starting my 'LTI journey' or whatever was one.. I was really anxious about emailing people, but now, like everything
                        else, it's just become another mundane. I don't know if you'd say <i>that's</i> a good thing, but I'm (pretty) sure me getting more used to emailing people, especially professionally is... I don't know. Having a bit of a moment
                        as I write this, give me a second.
                        <br> Next LC, I want to continue this by emailing more people. I, again, have been very lucky as everyone who I've emailed has let me interview them, but I know I can't keep running off that luck forever.</p>
                    <h3><u>What have been your greatest struggles for this learning cycle?</u></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What have you learned from those struggles?</li>
                        <li>What are you going to do differently next Learning Cycle to address those struggles?</li>
                        <li> What support do you need to overcome those struggles?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The easiest one to point out would be the whole hack and what not... I think I was lucky in the sense that I use my own personal computer, and using my hotspot, I could still get my work done at roughly the same pace. But it would
                        definitely be disingenuous to say that was my 'greatest struggle'. The whole thing happened near the beginning of this year, while we were still doing our 'Who am I/Who are we' stuff. You've probably noticed I haven't mentioned
                        that in my exhibition, and I won't. Not really for any <i>real</i> reason, other than I think it's boring. Not work that would illustrate my abilities, you know? The lack of technology pretty much only affected that.</p>
                    <p>I think my 'biggest struggle' in reality was... Myself!! Wow! Who would've guessed! I know this is a problem but it happens every time! I quite literally do it to myself! The cycle never ends! I feel like it was some mixture of disappointment/the
                        feeling of being behind/decision paralysis/compartmentalizing <i>a little too much</i> that caused me to... Not do ■■! Can't even say I've learned anything from my strife, because to do that you have to actually overcome that problem!
                        Or at least for the problem to be new, you know?</p>
                    <p>I'll admit, I'm at a bit of a loss here. My dear, beloved silly little planner does wonders in helping me 'get my ■■ together', so to speak; but we're still here at the same place in the end, aren't we?</p>
