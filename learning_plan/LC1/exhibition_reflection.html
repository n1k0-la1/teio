                    <p>Please respond to the following in a complete paragraph per question. This reflection gives you the chance to think DEEPLY about where you are in relation to achieving your goals, as well as what SPECIFIC actions you must take to ensure
                        a successful and productive rest of the year.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <b><u>Describe your exhibition:</u></b> How did you feel? Do you feel like you were prepared? Do you feel like you presented well?<br>
                            <p>It went pretty good actually... But also pretty unremarkable me thinks? Not really sure how 2 word it. I was definitely not as prepared as I'd like to be, and I was still doing my finishing touches to my exhibition during lunch
                                or when I was waiting outside in the cold. I think I presented fairly good... I need to explain what I did bad more probably... But besides that I think my presentation is usually good, so it's nothing to really write home
                                about.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> <b><u>What were your successes during this learning cycle?</u></b> Do you feel like you did a good job presenting them? Do you feel like you oversold or undersold your successes at all?<br>
                            <p>The LTI stuff, while it's not a lot (/-/) is still a pretty big success considering how cagey I was about sending out emails and what not at the beginning of this year. I think it's a good foundation for me to build on this
                                LC. Uhm~ I dunnnnooo... My website probably? I don't know if I did a good job presenting that, I wasn't really sure how to explain what I learned besides “I didn't know any of this before and I know how to do it now.” I
                                feel like I sold them... The appropriate amount? But I'm probably wrong thinking that... </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> <b><u>What were your struggles during this learning cycle?</u></b> Do you feel you were honest and constructively focused when you presented your struggles?<br>
                            <p>I feel like I presented my struggles quite a bit, candidly, (though that might not be a good thing.. el oh el...) but I wasn't really constructive with it. Like one of my panelists said, i just went “this is bad ::nods::” and
                                again, had trouble explaining why, or my next steps. I think part of that is I just don't know what my next steps are myself, so I probs need help w/ that...</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b><u>What was some of the SPECIFIC feedback you received at your exhibition?</u></b><br>
                            <p>“Contact the SAM even if you think they wont respond”; “Add specific quantitative trackers 4 LP (i.e., have tracker of dates you did things as well)”; “Make goals S.M.A.R.T.-er, mostly specific, mesurable and ambitious”; “More
                                explicit connection to SR & ER”</p>
                        </li>
                        <li> <b><u>What are some SPECIFIC new goals you will set for the next learning cycle?</u></b><br>
                            <p>Not really a new goal per say ??? Add trackers to them w/ dates. I'm not really sure what other goals I should add yet.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li> <b><u>What do you need/want/require help with?</u></b> Who can you ask for this help? What kind of help? BE SPECIFIC<br>
                            <p>I'm having trouble trying to figure out whether some of the work I'm doing/want to do should count as a project or as a goal... I can ask my advisor or one of the support staff for help. I think the kind of help I need is just
                                clarification.. And for someone else to make my decisions for me.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li> <b><u>What did you learn from being a panelist at other exhibitions?</u></b><br>
                            <p>I go to other people's exhibitions and I think "Oh hmmm I think this person didn't explain their ■■ well... I need to explain mine in more detail!" or I hear someone's feedback for that person and I preemtively account for
                                that feedback in my own exhibition. Nods. I dont think this is what the question was asking of me sorry but this is what you're getting.</p>
