                            <p><mark>0250318</mark> - First day of internship! yay! wow! got about halfway through shelf 2.B.2, Kathrine (my mentor) sat w me n explained how 2 do stuff. like what to put into Past Perfect (the cataloging software) (by the
                                burke! isnt that cool), tie the books up etc.</p>
                            <p><mark>0250325</mark> - finished shelf 2.B.2! yay! This time my mentor say @ a different desk and do her work and told me to ask her if i found anything weird, which i did. Need 2 make more tags. Made new accession # for found
                                in collections scrapbooks, & heres a picture i took. Look. Isn't it literally me? This is what I'm literally doing, except not presents <img src="https://file.garden/Ze6P3FucmRDZDfxQ/IMG_6870.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto;width: 30rem;">                                Also, mentor said to not b afraid of adding more detail stuff into discriptions, so trying to do that now.</p>
                            <p><mark>0250401</mark> - April first! did not do any pranks. Started on shelf 2.B.3 & got a little under halfway through. here is a picture of the desk i'm at. <img src="https://file.garden/Ze6P3FucmRDZDfxQ/IMG_6897.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto;width: 40rem;">Also,
                                asked & starting interships on thursday this thursday! yay! </p>
                            <p><mark>0250403</mark> - First day of being unsupervised! (hyperbole) I sat downstairs this time, and that desk has a nice keyboard and mouse and ergonomic office chair :) Thingd to for next time: what to do about empty album
                                covers? 93.10.30.22??? ( glenn wright age 2) Check papers 4 beth marthin 's scrapbook Here is a picture of a note written by another archivist that i thought was hysterical, but might've only been because i was alone in
                                a haunted collctions room with mostly no human interaction looking at dead people 's stuff. <img src="https://file.garden/Ze6P3FucmRDZDfxQ/IMG_6907.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto;width: 30rem;">Also I asked 4
                                a performance review over email, because I read that's a thing that managers like to hear</p>
                            <p><mark>0250408</mark> - Spring break! i still went 2 my internship though cus I already started late and also I am scared of confrontation. Had mentor look over work and she said it was fine, and to add more detail to desc.
                                with what researchers are searching in mind. Need 2 go back & change Washington Congress of Parent and Teachers Scrapbooks using 2012.20.2 desc & make more tags. I can barely hole punch 3 pieces of paper at once, this is
                                rigged
                            </p>
                            <p><mark>0250410</mark> - still spring break, still unsupervised. Found a scrapbook that has the accession # but does not line up w; past perfect, looked 4 it in donation paperwork but the paperwork said the list was somewher
                                else in the accession #'s 'Collection List', which I dont know how 2 find. Texted Kathrine, she said put it on the problem pile will explain next time. </p>
                            <p><mark>0250415</mark> - Keeping up the pace of roughly half a shelf per day, but the bottom shelf is really weird so going to put that to the side 4 now and go through some of the boxes. So I was taught how 2 do boxes. Naming
                                them is weird and not sure i get it.</p>
                            <p><mark>0250417</mark> - Watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRk4xV50ruw&authuser=2" target="_blank">one of the training videos</a> my mentor sent me, the computers were all off and logged out and weird when I got
                                in so had to do some troubleshooting w Kathrine. Went through more boxes, lots of Mt.View photo albums. Why were the photo albums back them so much nicer than the ones I got. Rigged. 'Oh ■■ sites are a thing' > goes back
                                and adds/updates sites to scrapbooks i did. Also, maybe getting naming boxes? The first rule of controlled language and museum nomenclature is to have fun and be yourself (joke) </p>
                            <p><mark>0250422</mark> - Chrissy was there 4 a site visit and watched me 4 like an hour, I Did some of the heavier boxes ones I couldn't get down on my own, and wrapped some things that used 2 b in boxes so to just put them on
                                the shelf
                            </p>
                            <p><mark>0250424</mark> - Finished scrapbook boxes on shelving unit (??) 2.C, went back 2 the mess that is 2.B.5. Found negitive tucked in photo album? aksed mentor, told to leave it for committe meeting next tue. Also watched
                                the other
                                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTB8aDgTRtc" target="_blank">training video</a></p>
                            <p><mark>0250429</mark> - Sat in on collections committe meeting where they talked about what to keep etc., talked to Mycah (other archivist that's the main photo person) about negitive told it was fine to leave in because we
                                don't know who these people are/not a very big priority. Mycah told me how 2 get and print out barcodes for the scrapbooks so far, I try to put the sticker on a tag but it's too small, I realize that means I'm going to
                                have to redo all the tags for the like hundred scrapbooks I've done, rip. Here is a photo of the tags I made: <img src="https://file.garden/Ze6P3FucmRDZDfxQ/5BDDEFA0-E580-4569-974C-233E67D4D357.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto;width: 30rem;">I
                                finished redoing all the tags 4 2.B.2 and got a neck cramp</p>
                            <p><mark>0250501</mark> - Printed more labels and redid more tags for most of the rest of the scrapbooks i've done (~3 shelves) and need to ask next time how to do barcodes for boxes & what my mentor wants to be done about the
                                clerk's record books. Also figured out a better looking and using method of tying the tags that gave me less neck cramps, so yay. Printers are the bane of my existance.</p>
                            <p><mark>0250506</mark> - Finished redoing all the tags so now they all have barcodes. Yay. Except for the ones in boxes cus idk how. Asked Kathrine though and she's going to ask Mycah. Also finished 2.B.5 (yay) and now starting
                                on the archive shelfs. IM FREE!!</p>
                            <p><mark>0250508</mark> - Auuuggghhhh i felt so hashtag off my game todaaayyy.... Jonathan Sims save me... Save me Jonathan sims... Maybe I'm not actually off my game but doing new things and it's hard so therefore I'm not going
                                at the rate I normally do... Hmm... Sounds fake. Idk. These archives shelves are CONFUSING! and i dont knoooowwww. I asked Kathrine if there was a cannonical guide 4 naming boxes because I'm back to thinking I don't get
                                it but no resp
                            </p>
                            <p><mark>0250513</mark> - Getting bit more comfortable... maybe... But also I am So Confused All The Time. Think I left my headphones there? rip. Also, look at this cute collage of a blackboard i found in a PTA scrapbook! Wow!
                                Evidance!
                                <img src="https://file.garden/Ze6P3FucmRDZDfxQ/IMG_7140.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 20rem;"></p>
                            <p><mark>0250515</mark> - Felt like I really chugged along this time! yippee! Feels like i almost got carpel tunnel though... Not Yippee. I finished up the oral history box, and got through this big ol box of sewing patterns!
                                It bight be because both of these were relatively straightforward, but I feel like I really got in the groove this time and was able to finish them without much trouble.</p>

                            <p><mark>0250520</mark> - Omg... Literally had a mouse-eating-cheese moment... I cataloged tapes... In an archive... That had ghosts & was green themed... Omg... I mean, they were vhs tapes, but you know. Close enough.<img src="https://file.garden/Ze6P3FucmRDZDfxQ/IMG_7181.jpg"
                                    style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 20rem;">ALSO WHO THE ■■ WRITES DIRECTLY ONTO A CD... NOT EVEN THE PRINTED PART YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WRITE ON, THE LITERAL CD... why.</p>
                            <p><mark>0250522</mark> - Today I mostly worked on a Community Events & Holidays box, and that had a bunch of Seattle World's Fair stuffs, which was cute because the 6th graders held/are holding/will hold <i>their</i> world's
                                fair!
                                <img src="https://file.garden/Ze6P3FucmRDZDfxQ/IMG_7189.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 20rem;"></p>

                            <p><mark>0250527</mark> - Also felt a liiiiiiittle bit off my game today, but that might be because I was a bit preoccupied thinking about webnovels. I'm Just Like Kim Dokja FRFR. Finished the Community Events & Holidays box,
                                finished two other smaller boxes, but I feel like I could've done more... Anyways, here's a brochure I found about a mall that 'recently opened' (In 1973), and I looked it up and apparently it's still around. The mall's
                                <a href="https://www.gilmanvillage.com/" target="_blank">website</a> is absolutely darling, check it out RIGHT NOW!!<img src="https://file.garden/Ze6P3FucmRDZDfxQ/IMG_7212.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto; width: 20rem;"></p>

                            <p><mark>0250529</mark> - The weirdness followed me to today, and I think I breathed in a little more rust than healthy... Like I was taking out these DISGUSTING staples out from pamphlets, and i dont like using the jaws cus it
                                chews up the paper, so i use my exacto to unfold it & pull it out, but in the process I scraped off and breathed a bunch of dust... and my throat kinda really hurt after that... also i poked myself w the rust covered exacto,
                                but i'm sure it's fine.</p>
                            <p><mark>0250603</mark> - I totally thought I was going to miss my bus this morning!! 'Cus it just didn't show up?!?! I thought I was just being a silly stupid dumb dumb and missed it, but other people were like 'dude the bus
                                b4 u didnt show up' so i feel a little better. Today I learned from my mistakes and DID NOT put my face right up by the rust! Yay! And i asked my mentor if we had extra spacers for boxes but we didn't (broke) so diy-ed
                                one :proud: Also I left early @ 1:20 to catch a bus to takeshi & kallie's panels and totally forgot to clock out... again...</p>
                            <p><mark>0250605</mark> - Today I fought a staple and lost. Also, it's the last day of my internship! -Before summer, anyways. I cleaned up some loose ends and put stuff away, and got through a couple boxes as well.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div id="sone" class="tabcontent">
                            <p><mark>0250716</mark> - Summer internship time! we switched the dates so I come in on wenesdays & fridays instead of thursdays and tuesdays because thats when more people are here. Today my mentor was out because of medical
                                stuff, so I just continued where I left off and started working through some boxes that were on the archival shelf. Finished like 2 small ones and got 1/3rds the way through another larger one. I just realise now as i'm
                                writing this that i didnt put paragraph tags at the beginning of this. Anyways. Look at this handwriting workbook... not to bully like a 5 year old but... What happened here... koe... 🥀<img src="https://file.garden/Ze6P3FucmRDZDfxQ/IMG_7609.jpg"

                            <p><mark>0250719</mark> - A while back the museum held an exhibit about old kitchenware and such exhibit and when they took it down they put all the stuff on the big table. It's been there ever since I first took a tour of the
                                museum in middle school. It's a bit of a bother. So I was tasked to wrap them an put them away because they all nicely had locations in pastperfect. I got through most of them, and <a href="https://file.garden/Ze6P3FucmRDZDfxQ/icecreamscoopasmr.mov"> omg look at this ice cream scoop i fell
                                in love</a>. If any kind sponsor is reading this they are like 25-30 bucks on ebay... Just saying...</p>
                            <p><mark>0250723</mark> - okay today i LOCKED IN!!!! because i felt like I probably couldve done more last two days... I created numbers & wrapped up some new donations (plaque adverts for the White Center Home Garden Tour, of
                                all things,); finished the big box of booklets I started on 0250716; wiped down this big evergreen highschool sign so they could put it on the wall; and finished packing up the kitchen utencils. So locked. Didn't let my
                                orving over orv releasing yesterday (go read orv) or watching superman yesterday (which was v good!) distract me. locked like youo wouldn't believe. </p>
                            <p><mark>0250725</mark> - today i worked on some scrapbooks from the evergreen donation I wrapped up and put away, and then I made numbers for the musician cds and bow lake cds that were all on the table!</p>
                            <p><mark>0250730</mark> - today i did some school documents, which made me depressed, and a bunch of posters. we dont have any boxes which were the right size for them though rip so i wrapped them up in the yellow paper and string
                                instead. the table’s much cleared-off-er though now! :-) except new things keep getting put on it lol</p>
                            <p><mark>0250806</mark> - guess who jinxed it HELLO?? a lot of airplane stuff was taken off exhibit and dumped on the table so I'm working on that now. The exhibit was put in when they first moved to/built the museum, which means
                                they for some reason didnt make any catalog records for the whole accession and instead just listed everything in the desc??? Which ??? Hello ??? I mean thank you for putting numbers to faces, but would it really be that
                                much more time consuming to just make entries???? Ok. There were a bunch of luggage tags and such i cataloged, and airplane photos. Oversized photos are the devil, actually.</p>
                            <p><mark>0250808</mark> - kept on going on w the airplane stuff. Mostly photos, but there were many points where i was like... why do we have this... Do we really need this guy's childhood drawings of planes... do we really need
                                the photos of planes from various commercial calendars... Like not even the whole calendar someone just ripped out the photos and decided to give them accession numbers. Okay. Sure.</p>
