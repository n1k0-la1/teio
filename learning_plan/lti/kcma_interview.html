                    <br> did not record. lol. oops!
                    <h3><u>IV. Reflection ^^</u></h3>
                    <p style="font-size: 70%;">Reflect on your preparation for the interview: Did your questions help you learn more about the person and your interest?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <b>Which questions were the best? Why?</b><br>
                            <p style="font-size: .85rem;">I did NOT want to do this interview to be honest uaghh... I think the best questions I asked were the ones about hiring/resumes since this person is a management person so they know more. nods. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> <b>Which questions do you need to get rid of or reword? Why? </b><br>
                            <p style="font-size: .85rem;">I was a bit long winded, and I feel like I was trying to get at something that wasn't actually real</p>
                        </li>
                        <li> <b>What are you most proud of from the experience? Why? </b><br>
                            <p style="font-size: .85rem;">i dont think I'm esp proud of anything.... </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> <b>What can you improve on for your next interview experience? Who can help with this?</b><br>
                            <p style="font-size: .85rem;">It was a bit of an awkward/stilted interview, not sure how 2 fix that though. Tbh, i feel like I'm kinda done w interviews, so I think at this point I should just start sending shadow day reqs</p>
                        </li>
