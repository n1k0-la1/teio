                        Hi chat, welcome to my 101 level up panel. Hit that sub button and turn on the notification bell if you haven't already, and let's dive right in!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I couldn't help myself. For realsies though, my name is Niko, and welcome to my level up panel! Thank you so much for coming! You've all already paged through my portfolio, so this letter is just to highlight my main evidence on
                        why you should definitely totally let me graduate into 201 year. If you haven't already grabbed a feedback form and pencil, please do so! Sadly, I'm not allowed to speak during the exhibition besides reading this letter, (I know!
                        How will you manage without my lovely dulcet voice!!) so I'll try to say everything here. Even so, I'm not omniscient (yet), so please ask questions if anything comes up, or something seems interesting and you'd like to hear more!
                        -Or even if not. I crave attention!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This year, it's like I've really gotten into the essence of Big Picture! -Like I'm finally able to do what I've been waiting for ever since I first got here in middle school, internships! I feel I was very lucky in my LTI starting off, I already knew
                        Nancy from middle school 'cus I was in the museum exhibit building seminar, which helped me get a foot in the door. Thanks past me for the foresight... I guess. That's not to understate the work I've put into LTI this year though,
                        If you'd be so kind as to look at my LTI tracker, you can see I've made a whole bunch of contacts, and I got responses from basically most of them! That's pretty rare from what I hear, and although I'm sure choosing a perpetually-at-their-work-computer
                        demographic is helping with that, I think my emailing skills have significantly improved, not just the writing bit, but also Being Normal About Emailing People. It's been super cool to dig deep into the field, and even though it's
                        a little (a lot!!)) terrifying because everyone seems to know everyone???, I think it'll be a really good leg-up for me in this crazy competitive job market. I've also tried to be extra diligent in my internship at the Highline
                        Heritage Museum, and this summer, I'm planning on continuing my internship there for the month of July and August so I can learn more! So far, the competencies I've engaged the most with is COM through creating a professional voice
                        for myself both in writing emails and in my workplace behavior; QR through logical reasoning and problem solving, for example if I find a scrapbook with no ID# but there's a name, I can look through deeds of gifts to see if there's
                        a record of things that person donated to see if it correlates with it. </p>
                    <p>
                        I feel much the same with projects, but whether I've taken advantage of the opportunity is another case however... I've done two (real) projects this year, TEIO—fleshing out my website, and Conceptual Design—filling out a sketchbook. The former which
                        I finished, and the latter which I didn't. I know, I know. This is the part where you throw rocks at me. [pause for stone throwing] (aren't I so kind and thoughtful for adding audience participation breaks :) ) In my creating my
                        website, I've engaged in COMS through MULTIMEDIA LITERACY by 'Effectively use technology to acquire, evaluate, construct, and present information.' and 'choosing and implementing most effective media for purpose, audience, and
                        context.' E.g., my audience is other indie web/art nerds, so my website looks much different than if I was making a professional tech-bro website, and even within my own website the Art Gallery is much less visually cluttered than
                        my homepage because they serve different purposes; ER through UNDERSTAND[ing], USE[ing], AND INVESTIGATE[ing] A FIELD OF SCIENCE, in my case coding; and QR through MODELING AND PROBLEM SOLVING & LOGICAL REASONING when I have to
                        debug my code/figure out how to make something new.
                    </p>
                    <p>This year, my competency engagement has definitely been stronger than those of past:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Both my projects and my Art Critique Seminar work are heavily centered around COMMS skills, and I feel like it's the competency I'm strongest in. Through art critique, I've done EXPRESSION AND ANALYSIS & PRESENTATION AND FEEDBACK
                            where I have to both create a piece that properly <i>expresses</i> the message & themes I have in mind, and break down other's pieces to analyze; Through my Chinese work, I've 'Develop[ed] and utilize[d] oral and/or written
                            communication in another language.' (which is also EXPRESSION AND ANALYSIS) and I've utilized UNDERSTANDING by synthesizing my knowledge of Cantonese to make learning Mandarin smoother, to the point where I am now a 'Novice-High'
                            on the ACTFL scale!
                        </li>
                        <li>My advisory work in Current Events and Literary Analysis satisfy the SR requirements pretty well I'd say, but in my 201 year I'd also like to have my own work be here in this catagory rather than just relying on the work strictly
                            assigned to me.</li>
                        <li>I feel like overall I've grown and become a more well-rounded person this year in PQ, especially with regards to having a PRODUCTIVE MINDSET. I think this is most exemplified in my Literary Analysis. In the beginning, I had lots
                            of trouble writing. As always, my perfection complex made it very hard for me to do anything at all, causing me to put it down for... a couple months. Oops. When I came back to it, I realized that it was literally fine. Anything
                            worth doing is worth half-assing, even if you're scared just do it scared, they don't want it perfect they want it by Monday etc. etc. I definitely wouldn't say I've gotten over my perfection complex—that would probably take
                            a lot more work I do NOT want to get into—but this is serious progress. We too, like the proverbial monkeys jamming away at typewriters, can write Shakespeare if we yap enough.</li>
                        <li>I also engaged in QR through my tutoring work! This year I finished up a math notebook, which like, I didn't know that was a thing I could do. I'll pass them out now. At the end of this year, I also did a practice SAT test (#5,
                            if you're interested) and got a 1260!! That's super good growth for me in my opinion, considering at the beggining of the year I was too scared to even try to take it!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I feel my vision for my 201 year is a little grainy right now, but there are four main points I'm currently thinking about. After I level up, I know I want to spec into art more (
                        <- says that every time), and I hope to do some projects that 're a little more interesting than just 'Fill out a sketchbook ' or 'rebuild my site
                            '. I think the logical next step for my current project is to actually make and finalize a polished lore/art book.. maybe I could print a copy out any everything & it would be cool, but that's just an idle fantasy for now. I know we 're starting to write our auto bio next year as well, so I think I'd also like to do a couple small projects in RPGmaker so I can learn the skills to achieve my auto bio dreams by 401
                            year (hopefully). Thirdly, I want to prepare for Running Start, which I hope to get into in 301 year. One specific subject is my Chinese, because I think I have to take heritage?? But that
                            's scary, so I want to at least study up a little bit so I don't make a fool of myself. That 's not the point, I know, but it 's either that or work on unraveling my weird complex around success, and that seems harder. Finally, I 'm not sure if I
                            'm going to stay at my current internship next year. I think it 's a really cool place that I 'm learning a lot from, but since I 'm also volunteering there over the summer, that's basically like staying there for an extra
                            semester. Probably. I think it 'll all clear up more as I have more time to ponder and I receive feedback (push push nudge nudge), but those are the main considerations I 'm holding over to next year. </p>
