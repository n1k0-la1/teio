                    <p>Please respond to the following in a complete paragraph per question. This reflection gives you the chance to think DEEPLY about where you are in relation to achieving your goals, as well as what SPECIFIC actions you must take to ensure
                        a successful and productive rest of the year.

                    <ul>
                        <li> <b><u>Describe your exhibition:</u></b> How did you feel? Do you feel like you were prepared? Do you feel like you presented well?<br>
                            <p>
                                Ughh... It went fine. Whatever. I did not feel like I was prepared, but even so I presented alright. As always. I felt BAD! Very stressed and anxious. I guess to me, my exhibitions feel more like presenting to impress than just to check in on where I'm
                                at; which is why I probably feel so stressed about it. I'm not sure if that's a bad thing or not. Probably? -Seeing it like that is probably a bad thing, I mean. I know that it's not <i>supposed</i>                                to be like that, but I don't I can bring myself to change, because I feel like it would be such a big disrepancy everyond'd be dissapointed in me. That's not the point either I know, but . I like being praised.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> <b><u>What were your successes during this learning cycle?</u></b> Do you feel like you did a good job presenting them? Do you feel like you oversold or undersold your successes at all?<br>
                            <p>
                                I think I sold myself the appropriate amount??? I guess my panelists don't feel the same, but. You know. My presentation is always same-same, aka fine, so I don't think it was me underselling it per-say... I think maybe I just mixed it with a little too
                                much self loathing. Or, somethimes I learn things and internalize them into thinking it's common knowledge, and thus present them poorly because I forgot I learned it. Maybe it;s that.

                        </li>
                        <li> <b><u>What were your struggles during this learning cycle?</u></b> Do you feel you were honest and constructively focused when you presented your struggles?<br>
                            <p>
                                I think I was honest, at least. Not sure if I was 'constructively focused' though. I have a problem with that, I know. I present my issues in hope that someone'll see them and fix it all for me. I'm doing it again now. How funny.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                A specific piece of feedback I recieved from like everyone actually, was to be kinder to myself/have more realistic self-eval.

                            <p>
                                Good question

                                I need a sabbatical. Besides that, I'm really struggling with my literary analysis. I just don't want to do it so bad. Not sure how someone could help w that, but. I also don't really get trig identities, but that's a tutoring thing. I want to prioritize
                                art more becauase it's such a big part of me but I keep tucking it away because it doesn't feel like legitimate work. I can ask Andy to help with this by providing me more art work to do like he mentioned in his exhibition

                        <li> <b><u>What did you learn from being a panelist at other exhibitions?</u></b><br>
                            <p>
                                I went to Khan's exhibition and the way they connected their learning to the compitencies was really admerable, I wanna do that! It'll def require more actual exhibition-prep though I think.
