                    I have a really hard time writing about myself. Who would've guessed. So I had a lot of trouble with this, who would've guessed. But, I wanted to get at least something down on paper, so I wrote Kim Dokja struggling with writing it in my stead! and eventually
                    stumbled upon a bit I could adapt into a 'real' 'memoir':
                    <div class="work"><i>'Is it really me who should be written about?</i>' The words sound ridiculous, even in my own mind. Just because a story is unremarkable, does that mean it shouldn't be written? -Every story deserves to be told, has someone that
                        would benefit from it, even if it was just for a little while. Who was <i>I</i> to think my life was so especially dull, especially pitiful, that I'm an outlier? This life too was worth telling, but knowing that didn't make it
                        any easier.
                        <br><br> Was that really so wrong? I didn't want to steep in my self-pity any longer.</div>
                    I think it's introspective and good and whatever, but like Put said in her reading of it, it's nooot exactly a memoir... It's a memoir of a thought i had, if you will, but it doesn't really contain a 'pivotal moment' that makes memoirs good. I think this
                    is because I am usually a fan of 'mundane stories'... So idk... Here's Put's full email.
                    <img src="https://file.garden/Ze6P3FucmRDZDfxQ/Screenshot%202025-05-19%20110008.png" style="display: block; width: 95%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 10px;"> This took me a long time to come up with a real genuine
                    memoir though... And we had a deadline where we had to show out classmates a WIP, so I threw this fake memoir together as well. el oh el. If you recognise this referance, no I haven't read it and I don't plan to, but I think you should
                    read ORV.
                    <div class="work">
                        A young student stares at their screen, fingers hovering over it's keys. It just so happens that today, the third of February, 2025, this student's 100 word memoir is due. Though it was five days ago this memoir was assigned, it is only today, three hours
                        before it's due, they'll be writing it.
                        <br><br> What will this memoir be about?
                        <br><br> > Write a memoir
                        <br><br> Wait, what? Do memoirs even need framing devices? 100-word-ones definitely don't. Is anyone going to recognize this reference? Do I <i>want</i> anyone to recognize this? I'm not doing this, this isn't even my actual memoir.

                    And here is the orv fanfic i wrote first instead of doing my work, lol:
                    <div class="work">
                        "Just because a story is unremarkable, does that mean it shouldn't be written?"
                        <br><br> "That's not what I meant"
                        <br><br> "Then what? That's what it sounded like."
                        <br><br> I sigh, this is what always happens. "Don't twist my words, Sooyoung-ah."
                        <br><br> "Every story has a reader who'd benefit from seeing it, how many times do I have to tell you for it to get through your thick skull?"
                        <br><br> "I know, it's just..." Her gaze drills into me as I trail off. I look away. "Is it really me who should write it?"
                        <br><br> Is it really me who should be written about? The words sound ridiculous, even in my own mind. Who was I to think my life was so especially dull, especially pitiful, that I'm an outlier to the rule?
                        <br><br> "...It's not going to be any good. That's what I mean."
                        <br><br> "Just shut up and write already, won't you? Or is it that you think you're so much better than everyone else?"
                        <br><br> And since when have you cared about that? It didn't matter when you were readingâ€”"
                        <br><br> "That's different." I quickly cut in.
                        <br><br> 'Ways of Survival' was a, maybe even the archetype of what she was talking about. Such a story, with only a single concurrent reader, could save that one person. Perhaps I should've known better than anyone, what a 'story'
                        could do. -Even so, I couldn't help but doubt.
