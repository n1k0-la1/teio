                        Mhâ€¦ <mark>Mid-high significant?</mark> I definitely use this format like, a bajillionn times more than any other learning plan I've had before, which is good; But like, I didn't really add that many new goals this LC. Still really
                        happy with this website, and I really like the layout & everything, but I made it in the prev LC, so don't think that counts. Added the <a href="/learning_plan/sitemap.html">sitemap</a> at feedback about it being difficult to navigate
                        though, if that's anything.</p>

                        [meow] if I know ðŸ’€ Fell all the way to Nova Scotia. The wicked beast known as "forgetting-everything-if-it-was-done-over-a-month-ago" and "remembering-things-but-thinking-'oh-that-was-so-long-ago'/'that's-stupid-it-shouldn't-count-I-basically-knew-that'-and-therefor-dismissing-them"
                        has stricken again; to nobody's suprise. I learned more trig. Finally figured out how calling child elements in css worked.</p>

                    <p>Uhm.. I was a 'Reflective Learner' through adjusting my next project plan using my identified growth areas from my old one as stated b4 (PQ); all the ER & COM stuff I mentioned in my project reflection, Design and Scientific Inquiry,
                        Expression and Analysis, Multimedia Literacy etc. etc.; Presentation and Feedback through presenting my art in art crit. seminar (COM); Logical Reasoning (html/cssâ€¦ if you count them as coding languages. Please do, for my sake.)
                        & Fluency and Computation the way I learn new math stuff (like trig) and synthesize it with old math I know (algebra like systems of equations) to solve the problems given (QR); and SR through writing the literary analysis 4 ATDOPTI
                        because of Critical Analysis (duh) & Institutions and Systems since the theme I'm writing about is systemic opression blah blah blah.
                    </p>
                    <p>Anyways, all that to sayâ€¦ <mark>low-mid-significant?</mark> Dunno.</p>
                    <h3><u>Where do you feel your project work falls on this rubric?</u></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> What new learning did you do in your projects? How does it connect to the competencies?</li>
                        <li> How has your ability to plan and execute projects grown?</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        It's better than last LC??? <mark>Between some/significant.</mark> Probably. I finished my previous project (yay), even if I'm not exactly the happiest with it (boo), and I have (in my opinion) a pretty good proposal for my next
                        project, that's taken into account my pitfalls with this one. Basically, that's all to say I don't think I did much <i>this LC</i> but I've built a foundation for my next LCâ€¦ Or something.
                    </p>
                    <h3><u>Where do you feel your LTI work falls on this

                    <ul>
                        <li> What have you learned through your LTI work so far? How does it connect to the competencies?</li>
                        <li> How have you improved your ability to work professionally with adults?

                    <p>
                        Probably <mark>low end of significant.</mark> Uhmâ€¦ Again, better than last time! That's got to count for something. I say this because I definitely got more contacts, I had 2 shadow days, etc. etc., and I think I'm pretty much
                        done with the interviewing cycle for nowâ€¦ But I really wanted to at least have and internship set up meeting by now, and that obviously hasn't happened. I feel a bit behind, like I probably should have an internship by now. Honestly,
                        I probably
                        <i>would've</i> had it by now, if not for that stupid snow a couple weeks ago! I was supposed to do the wing luke shadow day on the fith, send out my internship req emails after, and have a set up meeting some time last week. That
                        was all thrown off when the museum was closed due to snow, and we had to reschedule to a week later. It's really frustrating.

                    <p>
                        Uaauuughhhhâ€¦ It really hasn't felt like a whole LC at aaaallllâ€¦ Maybe because of winter breakâ€¦ I really feel like I haven't done anything this LC. (says this every time) Even if I'm not exactly where I wanted, I am still in talks to get an internship,
                        which has gotta count for something. I finished my project finally, and I think I'm setting myself up for... not-failure in projects next LC by having my proposal written out and everything.</p>
                    <h3><u>What have been your greatest struggles for this learning cycle?</u></h3>

                        <li> What support do you need to overcome those struggles?</li>

                        Myself, but you know. Whatever! Probably keepin up with schoolwork. I'm pretty behind on the Literary Analysis essay. I think most of it's because I keep doing more and more things thinking "oh, I can finish this it's fine"; and if that was the <i>only</i>                        thing I was doing then I'd be right, I could probably knock it out in a day; but it's not. I have a lot of trouble juggling things like this. But also I just don't want to. Lol. So the biggest problem is probably still getting
                        over myself, next to time management or whatevs
