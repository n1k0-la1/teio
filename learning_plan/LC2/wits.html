                    WITS (Writers In The Schools) was program where a real published (does that word even mean anything anymore) award winning author comes in to teach us about writing. Our teacher this time was Putsata Reang, and she taught us about writing memoirs with
                    the goal of each and every one of us having a <a href="100word.html">100 word memoir</a> but the end of the unit. At the start of the class we'd do warmups based on a certain prompt. Here are mine. A not-statistically-insignificant
                    portion of these are orv related, because I am a very predictible person.
