                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Role of Systemic Oppression In Hope, and The Radical Power of Dreams In <u><i>Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian</i></u></h2>
                    <p class="indent"><u><i>Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian</i></u> is about a 14-year-old boy named Arnold, who we come to know as Junior, transferring from his home-school of Wellpinit in the Spokane Reservation to Reardan, a majority-white
                        school miles away. The book focuses on the dichotomy between these two settings, and through this, examines the flaws and intricacies of both. We witness as Junior first hand experiences the inequities of both worlds, and how his
                        experiences outside the reservation recontextualize those within.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">‘Who is allowed to hope’ is a concept pushed by the system, used to oppress. Early in the book, Junior’s dog, Oscar, becomes deathly sick. His parents make the decision to put him down, that it’d be best to take him out of his misery.
                        He tries to convince them to take Oscar to the vet, but it's futile. They can't afford it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="quote">“Honey, it’ll cost hundreds of dollars, maybe a thousand.”

                        <br><br>“I’ll pay back the doctor. I’ll get a job.”

                        <br><br>Mom smiled all sad and hugged me hard.

                        <br><br>Jeez, how stupid was I?...There was nothing I could do to save Oscar.

                        <br><br>Nothing. (Alexie, 10)
                    </p>
                    <p>He cannot hope for more because he, and the rez is poor. He can’t even go through the motions of trying to get care for his dog, hold out hope a little longer, because he is poor.
                    </p>
                    <p> Even in essential services for <i>humans</i>, they are denied. For instance, due to Junior’s surgery, he had lasting brain damage that caused him to grow ten more teeth than average, and have eyesight so impaired that he needed glasses
                        at age three. Because they are poor, they have to lean on the Indian Health Service to fund his health care, meaning he has to get all his extra teeth pulled in one day. This already risky procedure, is made worse by their white
                        dentist, who “believed that Indians only felt half as much pain as white people did, so he only gave us half the Novocain.” (Alexie, 3) This would’ve been hard for any family, but once again, because they are Indians, they have
                        it worse.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">Under the existing system, hope costs money. But like he says a little later on, “And it’s not like my mother and father were born into wealth. It’s not like they gambled away their family fortunes. My parents came from poor people
                        who came from poor people who came from poor people, all the way back to the very first poor people.” (Alexie, 11) This generational poverty is also the reason Junior’s parents never got the chance to dream either. When talking
                        about them early in the book, he says: “Given the chance, my mother would have gone to college.” (Alexie, 11) And again, as he doubts himself when arriving at Reardan: “Nobody in my family had ever gone near a college.” (Alexie,
                        56) It was his mother’s dream to have something more, ever since she was a child. But this dream, this hope for a better future, is all but out of reach just because she so happened to be born on the rez. Just so happened to be
                        Indian, just so happened to be poor. But there isn’t anything ‘just so’ about it. Like Junior says: “Seriously, I know my mother and father had their dreams when they were kids. They dreamed about being something other than poor,
                        but they never got the chance to be anything because nobody paid attention to their dreams.” (Alexie, 11)</p>
                    <p class="indent">Dreams, hope, are an integral part of life. By denying people hope, it’s killing them. During the first real turning point in the book, we hear Junior’s (former) math teacher, Mr. P have a heart-to-heart with him. “If you stay on this
                        rez,” Mr. P said, “they’re going to kill you. I’m going to kill you. We’re all going to kill you. You can’t fight us forever.” (Alexie, 35) We see Mr. P’s words ring true over the course of the book, exemplarily in Junior’s sister,
                        Mary. After all, what Mr. P’s talking about isn’t a literal death, but the death of the spirit. “I didn’t literally kill Indians. We were supposed to make you give up being Indian. Your songs and stories and language and dancing.
                        Everything. We weren’t trying to kill Indian people. We were trying to kill Indian culture.” (Alexie, 28)
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">Just like Junior, Mary started off with dreams. She wanted to be a novelist, and she was always writing, even if in secret, chasing for that big break. But by the time she graduated high school, she “... just froze. Didn’t go to college,
                        didn’t get a job. Didn’t do anything.” (Alexie, 21) She lives in their parent’s basement most of the day, never going out. When hearing about her previous dreams, Junior speculates that something bad must’ve happened to her, after
                        all: “That had to be it, right? Something bad had happened to her, right? I mean, she lived in the fricking basement. People just don’t live and hide in basements if they’re happy.” (Alexie 31) But like his teacher says a little
                        later on, “Mary was a bright and shining star,” Mr. P said. “And then she faded year by year until you could barely see her anymore.” (Alexie, 32) Nothing specifically bad had to happen to Mary for her to become a ‘humanoid underground
                        dweller’, no catastrophic event, she simply ‘faded.’ Got worn down by her hopeless environment, until she might as well be living as if she were dead.</p>
                    <p class="indent">
                        It’s only when she finally takes a step into the world and dares to once again hope is she able to live again. She was able to rekindle the ashes of her spirit and live freely, in the vast fields of Montana. Junior gets another letter from her when she
                        finally settles in, “...I have started to write my life story. Really! Isn’t that crazy?” (Alexie, 106) Simply by entertaining that hope for something more, her dying spark was re-ignited. She could finally write again, not just
                        that, but she finally had the bravery to tell others about her writing. Maybe it’s ‘just trashy romance fiction’—or as Junior puts it, “Those romances [that] always featured a love affair between a virginal white schoolteacher
                        or preacher’s wife and a half-breed Indian warrior.” (Alexie, 31); that’s still a radical act, because that’s creating and cultivating culture. That’s her spirit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">Hope is made out to be a finite resource intentionally, specifically because it’s a radical act. Hope protects cultures. Hope fosters growth. Without hope, without dreams, can it truly be said that you’re still living?
