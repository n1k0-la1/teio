                    I want to persue writing more as an avenue to deepen my characters alongside my art, since I feel like often my art isn't very 'conceptually backed', or whatever. My goal is to write a little each day, no matter if it's good enough, so I can chip away
                    at those skills.
                    <br><br> Look, I know I said that you're not allowed to read my writing (because for the most-part you're not ^^) but like the proverbial monkeys typing away at a keyboard, I think I've written something pretty hillarious so I'm going
                    to be a kind soul and share it with the masses :heart emoji: (also I crave attention. yippe! please comment and kudo.) (also also i would make this an iframe so you can just view it from here but ao3 doesn't let others embed it :(
                    so you'll have to deal and click the link)

                        my wonderful friends<br />Summary:
                        <p>I (31 M) and Y (19 M) have been living together ever since I found him as a child on the streets when he was 5 and I was 17. There’s never been words or legalities put to it, as we’re both a bit ‘adverse’ to the powers that be
                            here, (-Who isn’t in Zhungong anyways,) but I’ve offered him a place to stay and took him under my wing, so to speak.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday, he confessed to me.</p>
                        <p>-</p>
                        <p>Aisou you IDIOT</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>I also have some snippets of things, such as the <a href="https://file.garden/Ze6P3FucmRDZDfxQ/Screenshot%202025-05-19%20131519.png">orv fanfic excerpt</a> I wrote instead of writing my memoir, and my <a href="/learning_plan/LC2/100word.html">real and fake 100 word memoir</a>                        I wrote for class. I hope to have more things to share in the future, but as of now my writing's mostly just nothing-burgers... (
                        <- most american saying ever btw) Working on it!!</p>
