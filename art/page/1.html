                <br> This was sooooo good but couldn't finish it in time 4 art crit.. sad.. I really like this concept!! I'm usually a very 'conceptually-lacking' typa person, so I'm really happy w what I came up w here! I've been told my faces are a
                bit flat, so i've tried to put more work into making his have more "oomhp" and I'm pretty happy w the result! The one thing is (besides the unfinished-ness lol) I'm not quite sure about his hair color... and i don't really have his design
                nailled down i feel like. I want to redo this piece in the future, but with a design for 華軒 more solidified in my head. -And with more time, of course.
