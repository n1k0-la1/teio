                <br> Based off <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/eat-yo-food-bitch-damn" tabindex="_blank">this meme</a> because I am a very serious person. I'm fairly happy w it..? The face is kinda flat :( I'm not the biggest fan of it besides
                his eye... I like how i did the colors in his hair but i feel like the shapes are a bit rudimentary, I'd like 2 have more detail there, especially since the eye is so detailed. ALSOOO the ears are a bit flat... especially w the earings
                on them. I think next time I want to bring more depth across the board, rather than in just a couple elements.
