                <b>AUAUUUGGGHHHHHH I NEED HIM DEAD</b>
                <br> This came to me in a vision in the middle of chinese class and I just HAD to draw it. It's not exactly what I was envisioning at first, but I'm still pretty happy with it! I'm especially happy with how I did the tension in the skin
                where he twists at the waist; the butcher's twine digging into his skin; and the first section of meat, especially because this is my first time doing something like this; and the dramatic lighting in general! Here are some beauty shots
                :proud:

                The thing is though... I feel like his face is a little flaaat like always, so I'm really going to try and focus on that next time. I feel like because of how flat it is/how it's more stylized than the rest of the body, it kinda sticks out like a sore
                thumb :( Also, I think the perspective with the latter parts of his tail is kinda out of wack... So i'll have ot be more mindfull of that next time. Even with that though, I really like this piece!
