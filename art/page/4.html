                <b>Yet Now, I Find I've Grown Into A Tall Child</b>
                <br>I need to stop saying "I'm back in the building again!" when it's obvious I haven't even been able to leave in the first place. Now, if you're thinking: "Is that...?" The answer is yes. This is C!Tommy, from the dsmp. Yup. This was
                an idea I've vaugly had ever since November(?), but I started working on it after the stream on friday the 23rd and my subsequent <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/niko-ro/784306217007890432?source=share">breakdown</a>, lol. <a href="https://file.garden/Ze6P3FucmRDZDfxQ/DOOONNTTSTOOOPTHEEPAARRRTTTYYYY.mp4"
                    target="_blank"> Basicaly,</a>
                <br><br>I'm pretty proud of this one!!! I really like how I did the face on him, especially because in my last piece I was pretty bummed with how it was incongruous from the rest & stuck out, so I tried extra hard this time! I really like
                the texture, and I feel like it's a very in-character face, if that makes any sense. I also tried to make the hair more complex than just simple shapes, since that's a thing I noticed in my Giamin piece.

                <br>I'm also very happy with how I did the sweater! I think the texture's super cute, but doesn't distract from the piece as a whole too much. One thing I don't really like though is the dog... I dont know how to draw animals... And I
                feel like it's the same situation w Jade's face, it's much less detailed than the rest of the drawing and kinda takes me out of it.
