                    <p>
                        First day of school and first post! Wow! -Actually, I probably won‚Äôt get it up until like a week later
                        <span style="color: darkslateblue">(me in the future, it was like 2 days lol)</span> ‚Äòcus I don‚Äôt have the page coded up‚Ä¶ But that‚Äôs besides the point! It counts, okay?!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mhmm‚Ä¶ I was really anxious for the last couple days since it‚Äôs my
                        <i>first day of highschool</i> and all! I woke up early (at 5:30) to get ready; Planned my outfit; Went to the bus stop early, etc‚Ä¶ But it feels like the same-old stuff. There‚Äôs only like 6 people I don‚Äôt know in my grade, and
                        they all seem.. Fine? I don‚Äôt know. Fairly non-offensive. Nothing to write home about. Everyone else is pretty much the same as before too; But this year I‚Äôm trying to work on being nicer (less of a brat „Äí‚ñΩ„Äí) and treating everyone
                        with a blank slate!!<br />...<br />Look, I know I say that every year, but I‚Äôm really working on it, okay?! Don‚Äôt judge me! Near the end of last year, one of my classmates were being particularly annoying, and I kept to myself
                        and kept my cool! My friend even commented on it, saying how I totally would‚Äôve went and yelled at that person if I was in 6th grade! Isn‚Äôt that at least something? ::>_
                        <:: </p>
                            <p>
                                Aaanyways, today was a good day. I took the metro bus to school, which I think I‚Äôm getting used to, and I saw some of my classmates and friends along the way! It was really nice, I got to chat with someone I don‚Äôt talk to often, and I really love public
                                transit in usual, hehe o(‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶)o ‚ÄîI went to Hong Kong this summer (Maybe I‚Äôll write about that later..?) And it was super cool for a lot of reasons, but the public transportation was defiantly one of them! The bus/train system
                                in China is really good, it‚Äôs super cool‚ÄîNothing ever happens on the first day of school, you know how it goes. I saw my old teacher, which was nice because
                                <i>she‚Äôs</i> super nice, and‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs about it!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I took the bus home it was super packed, which is to be expected, I guess‚Ä¶ ‚âß Ôπè ‚â¶ I almost wasn‚Äôt able to sit down, which would‚Äôve sucked because my bag was super heavy and my legs were super tired from walking down a big hill from my school to the
                                bus stop! While I was waiting for my connecting bus, an old lady came up to us unprompted and talked for what felt like 10 minuets about how all our SSNs got hacked and we needed to go to the library to freeze our bank
                                accounts because we can‚Äôt do it online since everything‚Äôs hacked??? She seemed like she had the best of intentions, and I was standing with my classmates so I wasn‚Äôt very scared, but it was weird‚Ä¶ (¬∞„É≠¬∞)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I got home, I finally placed my order for my 2025 Hobonichi‚ÄîI got all anxious about planning which one to buy before the release, but when Sept. 1st/Aug. 31st came around, I totally forgot about it all!! LOL. I got the Hobonichi Weeks like I always
                                do, this time in blue. I was considering getting the normal Techo because it had a Chinese version, but I feel like I really need a weeks spread for me to actually use a planner. I know the Cousin has a weekly, but for
                                both I probably wouldn‚Äôt use the dailies at all and feel bad about it. (I think there‚Äôs a Chinese ver. of the weeks but I can‚Äôt find it anywhere ÔºàÔºõ¬¥–¥ÔΩÄÔºâ ) I was originally planning to get the gray cover, but the grey this
                                year is kinda ugly compared to last year‚Äôs..? It‚Äôs fine.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                -Ah, I‚Äôm writing this right before bed so I should probably hurry up if I want to keep this habit of a good sleep-schedule up, so I guess I‚Äôll wrap it up now ^^ Sorry if this was all over the place, I don‚Äôt know how to write these things. I had fun! It
                                was a good day!
